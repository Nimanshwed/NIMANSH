Who doesn't want to enjoy the breathtaking view of the blue Arabian Sea while flying high up in the sky, defying the limits as it were? Parasailing is one of the most popular adventure sports on offer in Goa. Tourists usually prefer winch boat parasailing where the taking off and landing of the parachute happens on the winch boat itself attached at the other end of the parachute. Parasailing is a hot favourite amongst families, kids and couples as it offers the perfect combination of thrill and enjoyment while being comparatively easier than the other water sports. The best time to enjoy parasailing is from October to May when the sea is calmer, and winds are perfect for gliding the parachute.[]</li>
